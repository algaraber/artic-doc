## Project summary

The ARTIC network aims to enhance outbreak and epidemic response through real-time viral 
genome sequencing. Initially developed for high-consequence viruses like Ebola, the ARTIC protocol 
proved crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitating rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and global 
dissemination. For ARTIC 2.0 we will broaden the scope considerably to include endemic human 
pathogens, arthropod-borne viruses and zoonotic viruses as well as challenging new threats like the 
spread of AMR. We will enhance our ability to conduct responsive investigations of unusual or 
concerning changes in the pattern of infectious disease anywhere in the world, by leveraging new 
tools such as metagenomics. This could be a cluster of hemorrhagic fever of unknown aetiology but 
equally a spike of incidence in a known endemic arbovirus or childhood viral disease like measles. 
What links these events is that the investigations have to be sufficiently rapid that the information 
acquired can lead to effective response. ARTIC 2.0 will create a fully equipped toolbox where a 
robust, low-cost and accessible set of tools, that make use of the same equipment, reagents and 
bioinformatics, are ready to be rapidly applied to a wide range of investigations guided by an 
extensive knowledge base and flexible analysis pipelines.

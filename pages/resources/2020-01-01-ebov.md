> A collection of resources and documents for the genome sequencing of Ebola virus (EBOV) using Oxford Nanopore Technology's MinION platform. Includes a tiled primer scheme, complete lab protocol & equipement/reagent list.

The ongoing outbreak of [Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo](http://www.who.int/emergencies/crises/cod/en/) has highlighted the need for rapid sequencing ability to help with source attribution and to aid epidemiological investigations (including environmental reservoirs).

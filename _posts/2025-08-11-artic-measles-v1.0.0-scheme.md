### Summary 
We have recently developed the `artic-measles/400/v1.0.0` primer scheme ([labs](https://labs.primalscheme.com/detail/artic-measles/400/v1.0.0/)). This scheme has been designed to account for all genetic variation present across all Measles virus (MeV) serotypes allowing for the scheme to be used for samples of unknown (clinical samples) or mixed (environmental surveillance)  serotypes. 

This scheme also utilises 400bp amplicons; providing very high sensitivity enabling a range of use cases, while also being compatible with capacity build from using the similar 400bp `artic-sars-cov-2` schemes.

### Design of the scheme
For in depth details about how the scheme was designed, please see the [preprint](http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2024.12.20.629611). In summary, we used the latest version of primalscheme to produce multiple primers for each primer site to account for the diversity present in genomes of all serotypes.   

### Validation 
We performed initial validation in-house by testing the scheme against standards for 4 serotypes (A, B3, D4 and D5) and produced full coverage data with 100% base accuracy. Other collaborators have used the scheme with effective results (further communications incoming).
